# Russian-Roulette-Console
I've made a working Russian Roulette game, you can play with up to 4 friends, 
if you have none, you can test the game by yourself, and see how it works.


# How to play?
Inside the builds folder, just run the executable to start up the application.
Press any key to end your turn and let the best of luck wins.


# Note
The game is not flexible enough to include more players maximum of five, and renaming
the players as it is already defined inside the game. Also i may not be updating this game
as im busy with my current study. But if you wish to enhance it yourself, feel free to do it
just dont forget to credit me, thanks. :)
